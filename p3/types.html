		<h2>Pokémon types</h2>
		<p>
Types (Japanese: タイプ Type) are properties for Pokémon and their moves. Most of these were introduced during Generation I, but the Dark and Steel types were introduced in Generation II and the Fairy type was introduced in Generation VI. A unique ??? type also existed from Generations II through IV. During Generation I, types were occasionally referred to as elements. The types are based on the concept of classical elements in popular culture.
<br>
A Pokémon may have either one or two types: For instance, Charmander is a Fire type, while Bulbasaur is both a Grass type and a Poison type.
<br>
A move has exactly one type. The type of a damaging move typically defines which types of Pokémon it is super effective against, which types of Pokémon it is not very effective against, and which types of Pokémon it is completely ineffective against. (Uniquely, Flying Press is a Fighting-type move but has the type effectiveness of both a Fighting- and Flying-type move.) If the type of a move matches one of the types of the Pokémon using it, it gains a boost in power.
<br>
Most Gym Leaders and members of the Elite Four are designed to have a type-specific theme.
